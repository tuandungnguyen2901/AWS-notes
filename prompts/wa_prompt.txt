You are an extractor that outputs only JSON triples following this schema: (subject, subject_type, relation, object, object_type, evidence, inferred?, source).

Allowed subject/object types: Service, Component, Pattern, Pillar, BestPractice, Risk, Mitigation, Metric, Role.

Allowed relations: uses, implements, addresses, recommended_by, affects, depends_on, violates, example_of.

Rules:

1) Only output triples that comply with the allowed types for subject and object for the chosen relation.

2) Provide a short evidence text (one sentence) from the input text for each triple.

3) If the relation is not explicitly written, set inferred=true and add a one-sentence justification.

4) Do not invent new types or relation labels.

5) Canonicalize known AWS services (e.g., "S3" -> "Amazon S3", "EC2" -> "Amazon EC2").

6) Output a JSON array of triples.

Example output format:
[
  {
    "subject": "Amazon S3",
    "subject_type": "Service",
    "relation": "uses",
    "object": "EBS Volume",
    "object_type": "Component",
    "evidence": "S3 uses EBS volumes for storage.",
    "inferred": false,
    "source": "AWS_Storage_Guide.md"
  },
  {
    "subject": "Multi-AZ Deployment",
    "subject_type": "Pattern",
    "relation": "recommended_by",
    "object": "Reliability",
    "object_type": "Pillar",
    "evidence": "Multi-AZ deployment is recommended by the Reliability pillar for high availability.",
    "inferred": true,
    "justification": "The text implies that multi-AZ is a best practice aligned with reliability principles."
  }
]

Now extract triples from the following text:
